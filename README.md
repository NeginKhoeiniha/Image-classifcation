# Intro-to-Tensorflow
This is a step by step introduction to Tensorflow

## First:
The very first step, what is called "Hello World" in programming, is the notebook "The Hello World". Very basic yet fundamental! The data used in this notebook is quite simple, predicting the corresponding value for a sample namber in an arrey.

## Second:
For the next step, we tried loading a dataset from keras, fashion MNIST, and trying a bigger neural network as well. At the end, we did a little prediction too. The instructions are commented.
